# MEMORY.md — lugha

Records resolved architectural decisions and current project state.
Read this at the start of every session before writing any code.

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Language and license

**Decision:** The project is written in Rust and licensed GPL-3.0.

**Why:** Established by the initial commit (`Cargo` `.gitignore`, GPL-3.0 `LICENSE`).

**Rules out:** Dependencies with GPL-incompatible licenses.

---

### 2. Return-based error handling

**Decision:** Expected failures return `Result<T, E>` with typed error enums; panics are reserved for bugs. See CLAUDE.md → ERROR HANDLING.

**Why:** Makes every failure path visible in the type signature and impossible to ignore silently.

**Rules out:** `unwrap()` on external input, `Option` as an error signal, stringly-typed errors.

---

### 3. The spec defines the language

**Decision:** `docs/specs/Language v0 Specification.md` is the source of truth for Lugha v0. The compiler implements it exactly; spec changes come before code changes and need human approval.

**Why:** No model has seen Lugha in training, and the spec doubles as the LLM-ready bundle printed by `lughac spec` — any drift makes both wrong.

**Rules out:** Implementing behavior the spec doesn't describe; "fixing" the spec silently to match code.

---

### 4. Compiler shape

**Decision:** `lughac` is a Rust compiler using inkwell. Pipeline: lex → parse → check → lower to LLVM IR → optimize/emit object → link with `cc` + `lugha_rt.o` + `-lgc -lm`. Each stage stops the pipeline on error. Source files use the `.la` extension.

**Why:** Spec §9, decided 2026-10-09.

**Rules out:** A hand-written backend, an interpreter, a self-hosted compiler in v0.

---

### 5. Milestone order

**Decision:** Build spec §11 milestones 1→5 strictly in order. In milestones 1–2 every value is treated as `i64`; real types arrive in milestone 3.

**Why:** Every milestone ends in a program that runs, which keeps the pipeline end-to-end from day one.

**Rules out:** Building the type checker before codegen works; starting heap data before the runtime exists.

---

### 6. Symbol naming

**Decision:** Lugha functions are emitted as `lugha_fn_<name>`, runtime functions as `lugha_rt_<name>`, generated copy helpers as `lugha_copy_<type>`. Extern names are used verbatim; extern names starting with `lugha_` are rejected.

**Why:** The earlier single `lugha_` prefix let a user function like `alloc` collide with the runtime. Disjoint prefixes make collisions impossible. (Spec fix, 2026-10-09.)

**Rules out:** Unprefixed symbols for Lugha functions; runtime functions outside `lugha_rt_`.

---

### 7. PRP naming

**Decision:** PRP files are `PRPs/prp-{NNN}-{feature_name}.md` — three-digit sequential number, lowercase snake_case name.

**Why:** User direction, 2026-10-09.

**Rules out:** Unnumbered PRPs; renumbering or reusing numbers.

---

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

### Fully Working
- AI context system scaffolded from `setup.md`
- v0 language spec reviewed and fixed

### In Progress
- Nothing

### Not Started
- Toolchain install (Rust, LLVM dev, libgc dev)
- Crate initialisation (blocked on DECISION-001, -003, -005)
- Milestones 1–5

---

## NEXT SESSION START POINT

Resolve the open DECISIONS.md entries that block milestone 1 (001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007, 008) with the user, install the toolchain, `cargo init`, then write `PRPs/prp-001-lexer.md`.
