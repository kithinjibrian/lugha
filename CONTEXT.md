## SESSION 1 — 2026-10-09 — Context system setup — closed

Branch: main

### WHAT WAS DONE

Scaffolded the AI context system described in `setup.md`, adapted from its TypeScript examples to Rust: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, .llmignore, PRPs/ templates, docs/CODE_STYLE.md and the docs/ and reports/ folder structure. Project-specific facts that are not yet known (crate layout, error crate, edition/MSRV) were opened as decisions rather than guessed. `docs/DESIGN.md` was skipped — there is no UI.

Then reviewed `docs/specs/Language v0 Specification.md` and fixed its inconsistencies at the user's request: symbol prefixes (`lugha_fn_` / `lugha_rt_`), milestone 2 test program, struct passing, negative literal folding, negative repeat counts, exact acceptance outputs and float formatting, associativity, prefix grammar, `void` as a non-value. Source extension changed from `.lugha` to `.la`. PRP filenames set to `prp-{NNN}-{feature_name}.md`. Finally, updated CLAUDE.md (stack, 10 architecture rules, two kinds of error, anti-patterns, known issues), MEMORY.md (decisions 3–7), DECISIONS.md (001 narrowed to crate layout; new 005–010) and TODO.md (prerequisites and milestones) from the spec.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

docs/specs/Language v0 Specification.md — inconsistencies fixed, extension .la
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- None — no code yet.

### DECISIONS MADE

- Rust conventions replace the guide's TS ones: unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules, integration tests in `tests/`, `///` rustdoc, `Cargo.lock` protected from hand edits.
- File size limit set to 300 lines (the guide's default).
- PRP filenames: `prp-{NNN}-{feature_name}.md`, three-digit number, snake_case name.
- Source file extension is `.la`.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- DECISION-001 — What lugha is and its crate layout
- DECISION-002 — Error derive crate
- DECISION-003 — Rust edition and MSRV
- DECISION-005..008 — LLVM version, diagnostics crate, CLI parsing, test harness (open)
- DECISION-009, -010 — runtime location, array-copy cost (deferred)

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- Seven decisions block milestone 1: DECISION-001 (crate layout), -002, -003, -005, -006, -007, -008.
- Rust, LLVM dev and libgc dev are not installed on the dev machine.

---

## SESSION 2 — 2026-10-09 — Resolve milestone 1 decisions — closed

Branch: main

### WHAT WAS DONE

The user accepted the suggested option for every decision blocking milestone 1. Resolved DECISION-001, -002, -003, -005, -006, -007 and -008 and recorded them in MEMORY.md (decisions 8–12), CLAUDE.md (stack, testing, error handling) and TODO.md. For DECISION-005 the suggestion was "a version inkwell supports and Ubuntu packages"; checked both: Ubuntu 26.04's default `llvm-dev` is LLVM 21, and inkwell 0.10.0 (latest on crates.io) supports `llvm21-1`, so LLVM 21 was chosen. For DECISION-006 the suggestion was "codespan-reporting or hand-rolled"; chose codespan-reporting, with a milestone 3 check that it reproduces the spec's E0401 output.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
DECISIONS.md — 001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007, 008 moved to RESOLVED; no open decisions
MEMORY.md    — decisions 8–12, state and next start point
CLAUDE.md    — stack versions, tests/programs/ rule, stage return type
TODO.md      — decisions checked off, install and init steps made concrete
CONTEXT.md   — this entry
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- None — no code yet.

### DECISIONS MADE

- See above; all recorded in DECISIONS.md RESOLVED.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- None.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- Toolchain not installed (rustup, `llvm-21-dev`, `libgc-dev`).
- Crate not initialised.

---

## SESSION 3 — 2026-10-09 — Verify toolchain and initialise crate — closed

Branch: main

### WHAT WAS DONE

Verified the user's install: Rust 1.99.0, LLVM 21.1.8 (`llvm-config-21`, shared mode), libgc headers and library, cc 15.2. Initialised the crate: package `lugha` (library) with binary `lughac`, edition 2024, toolchain pinned to 1.99.0, dependencies inkwell 0.10, clap 4.6 (derive), codespan-reporting 0.13, thiserror 2.0. The first build failed: inkwell's `llvm21-1` feature links LLVM statically and Ubuntu ships no static Polly library. Switched to `llvm21-1-prefer-dynamic` and amended DECISION-005. Confirmed with a throwaway (deleted) example that inkwell builds and verifies a module, and that a C program links `-lgc`. fmt, clippy and test all pass.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
Cargo.toml          — package metadata, [[bin]] lughac, dependencies
Cargo.lock          — generated by cargo
rust-toolchain.toml — pins 1.99.0 + rustfmt, clippy
src/lib.rs          — crate doc only
src/main.rs         — crate doc + empty main
DECISIONS.md        — DECISION-005 amended (prefer-dynamic)
MEMORY.md           — decision 10 details, project state, next start point
CLAUDE.md           — stack versions, file tree
TODO.md             — prerequisites and init checked off
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- None — no behaviour yet.

### DECISIONS MADE

- Static LLVM linking abandoned for dynamic (DECISION-005 amendment).
- `license-file = "LICENSE"` in Cargo.toml rather than an SPDX id, since whether the project is GPL-3.0-only or -or-later is not recorded.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- None.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- No PRPs written yet.

## SESSION 4 — 2026-10-09 — PRP-001 test runner — closed

Branch: main → prp-001-test_runner

### WHAT WAS DONE

Ran the discovery interview for PRP-001; the user asked for a recommended answer with every question, now a rule in `PRPs/DISCOVERY.md`. Answers: mode chosen by `.exit` (run vs reject, optional `.stderr` for panic tests); per-milestone subfolders; one end-to-end test reporting every failure; strict malformed-case handling with a 10 s timeout; runner logic unit-tested now, end-to-end test `#[ignore]`d until milestone 1. PRP approved and implemented test-first on branch `prp-001-test_runner`. After `cargo fmt` the planned two files exceeded 300 lines; the user approved splitting by job (discover / execute / report, tests at the bottom of each), and the PRP's Structure section records the amendment.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
PRPs/prp-001-test_runner.md        — new PRP; status implemented; structure amended
PRPs/DISCOVERY.md                  — every question carries a recommended answer
tests/programs.rs                  — end-to-end acceptance test (ignored until M1)
tests/support/mod.rs               — module root
tests/support/fixture.rs           — temp-dir Fixture, exited() helper
tests/support/runner/mod.rs        — shared types, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
tests/support/runner/discover.rs   — case discovery + 9 tests
tests/support/runner/execute.rs    — process running with timeout + 2 tests
tests/support/runner/report.rs     — compare and report formatting + 6 tests
tests/programs/m1/arith.{la,stdout,exit} — §11 milestone 1 program, expects exit 14
CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, MEMORY.md — tests/ tree, shipped item, progress
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- discover.rs — recursive sorted discovery; run vs reject mode; 6 malformed layouts; empty root.
- execute.rs — timeout kills the child (200 ms limit); stdout/stderr/exit captured.
- report.rs — match, newline-sensitive mismatch, multiple mismatches, reject exit 1, timeout, escaping and truncation.
- programs.rs — end-to-end (ignored); currently fails with exactly `m1/arith.la: exit code, expected 14, actual 0`.

### DECISIONS MADE

- Recommended answers accompany every discovery question (user request).
- Runner split into discover / execute / report modules (user-approved file split).
- Timeouts kill the whole process group via `kill -KILL -<pgid>`, since `lughac run` spawns the compiled program.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- None.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- Nothing. Branch `prp-001-test_runner` fast-forward merged into `main` and deleted.

---

## SESSION 5 — 2026-10-09 — PRP-002 lexer — closed

Branch: main → prp-002-lexer

### WHAT WAS DONE

Discovery for PRP-002 (recommended answer accepted on every question): full §2 lexer now, with CLAUDE.md rule 9 amended so the lexer and parser cover the full syntax and only the checker and codegen follow milestone subsets; the full `Diagnostic` record without rendering; strict number rules; no raw newlines in strings; recovery after errors; codes E0101–E0108 plus E0109 (float out of range), which I added and the user confirmed. Implemented test-first: suites written against a `todo!()` stub (19 failing), then the lexer. One clippy finding (`3.14` read as approximate π in a test) fixed by changing the sample to `3.25`. Spec §2 now records the number and string rules and the error-code table.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
src/span.rs                — Span (byte range) + doctest
src/diagnostic.rs          — Severity, Label, Diagnostic, builders + test

src/lexer/number.rs        — integers and floats, E0104–E0109 + 9 tests
src/lexer/string.rs        — strings and escapes, E0102–E0103 + 4 tests
src/lib.rs                 — declares span, diagnostic, lexer
tests/lexer.rs             — every §10/§11 program lexes; M1 token list; no panic on any prefix
docs/specs/…Specification.md — §2 number/string details + lexical error table
PRPs/prp-002-lexer.md      — new PRP; implemented; Ty* naming note
CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, MEMORY.md — rule 9, file tree, progress
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- Unit: keywords and case-sensitivity; longest-match operators; comments; E0101 incl. multi-byte; error ordering; spans; integers, floats, `1..10`; E0104–E0109; strings, escapes, UTF-8; E0102 at EOF and end of line with resumption; E0103 continuing.
- Integration: all seven spec programs lex cleanly; exact milestone 1 tokens; every prefix of a mixed sample lexes without panicking.

### DECISIONS MADE

- Type-name keyword variants are `TyI32` … `TyString` (noted in the PRP).
- Lone `&` / `|` get E0101 with a "did you mean `&&`/`||`?" help.
- CRLF: `\r\n` ends a string's line like `\n`.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- None.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- Nothing. Branch `prp-002-lexer` fast-forward merged into `main` and deleted.

---

## SESSION 6 — 2026-10-09 — PRP-003 parser — closed

Branch: main → prp-003-parser

### WHAT WAS DONE

Discovery for PRP-003, with the recommended answer accepted every time:
- An owned AST tree with dense `ExprId`s.
- Recovery at statement and item boundaries.
- Codes E0201–E0205, plus E0206 (nesting limit 256), which I proposed and the user confirmed.
- An optional `;` after block-like statements; the struct-literal restriction lifts inside blocks; a lone `;` is an error.
- An S-expression printer.

Implemented test-first: 25 failing tests against stubs, then the parser. All passed on the first full run.

After `cargo fmt`, four files exceeded 300 lines. The user approved a split by concern: `ast/` folder, `parser/recover.rs`, `parser/primary.rs`, `parser/test_util.rs`. The PRP records it, along with `describe.rs`, the E0203 help wording and the shared `tests/common/spec_programs.rs`. Spec §3 now records the grammar clarifications and the E0201–E0206 table.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
src/ast/mod.rs, src/ast/expr.rs         — AST (items, types, statements; expressions, ExprId, ops)
src/parser/mod.rs                       — parse(), token cursor, mk, error reporting, close()

CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, MEMORY.md — file tree, shipped item, progress
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- Precedence, associativity, postfix chains, every literal form, if/else chains, tail vs statement, let and all assignment operators, loops and jumps, optional parentheses, items, expression bodies, externs, structs, array types.
- Each of E0201–E0206, including no stack overflow on 300 nested parens or 5,000 prefix minuses. Recovery at statements (3 errors) and items (2 errors). Dense ids and spans.
- Integration: all spec programs parse; the exact milestone 1 tree; no panic on any token prefix.

### DECISIONS MADE

- File split by concern (user-approved).
- `Type` derives `Eq` (needed because `TypeKind` holds `Box<Type>`).

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- None.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- Nothing. Branch `prp-003-parser` fast-forward merged into `main` and deleted.

## SESSION 7 — 2026-10-09 — PRP-004 codegen and link — closed

Branch: main → prp-004-codegen_and_link

### WHAT WAS DONE

Discovery for PRP-004, with the recommended answer accepted every time:
- Unsupported constructs give a typed `CodegenError::Unsupported { what, milestone, span }`; the driver will print it with exit 2.
- Arithmetic: `+ - *` wrap and `/ %` trap until milestone 4. Spec §11 moves overflow and division checks from milestone 3 to milestone 4, where `lugha_rt_panic` exists.
- Testing: build and run real binaries.

Implemented test-first against `todo!()` stubs. One test expectation was wrong: codegen reports the outermost unsupported construct, so `[1][0]` is "indexing". The test was corrected and a separate array case added. All checks pass; no `unsafe`; the largest file is 217 lines.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
src/codegen/mod.rs     — OptLevel, CodegenError, emit_ir, emit_object, host target machine (PIC)
src/codegen/lower.rs   — find_main, lugha_fn_main, C main wrapper, statement errors + 4 tests
src/codegen/expr.rs    — i64 literals, neg, + - * / %, trap guard, expression errors + 3 tests
src/link.rs            — link() via `cc … -lgc -lm -o`, LinkError
src/lib.rs             — declares codegen, link
tests/codegen.rs       — 6 build-and-run tests at -O0 and -O2
docs/specs/…Specification.md — §11: overflow checks moved to M4; interim wrap/trap note
PRPs/prp-004-codegen_and_link.md — new PRP; implemented; amendments
CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, MEMORY.md — known issues, file tree, progress
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- Unit: the C `main` wrapper and `lugha_fn_main` naming; a void main returns 0; no `nsw`/`nuw`; `/` and `%` guarded by `llvm.trap`; Unsupported for items, statements and expressions with milestone and span.
- Integration:
  - `2 + 3 * 4` exits 14.
  - `-7 / 2` exits 253, `7 % -3` exits 1, `-(3 - 10)` exits 7.
  - The wrapping case exits 254.
  - `1 / 0`, `1 % 0` and `MIN / -1` give SIGILL.
  - A void main exits 0.
  - `link` failure carries `cc`'s stderr.
  - Every case matches at -O0 and -O2.

### DECISIONS MADE

- Overflow and division checks belong to milestone 4 (spec §11 amended).
- Outermost-first reporting of unsupported constructs.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- None.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- Nothing. Branch `prp-004-codegen_and_link` fast-forward merged into `main` and deleted.

## SESSION 8 — 2026-10-09 — PRP-005 lughac driver — open

Branch: main → prp-005-driver

---

## NEXT SESSION START POINT

Run a discovery interview for the milestone 1 driver PRP (`PRPs/prp-005-…`): `lughac build`/`run`/`check`, `--emit=tokens|ast|ir`, `-O0`/`-O2`, human diagnostics via codespan-reporting (check early that it can reproduce the spec's E0401 layout — DECISION-006) and `--diagnostics=json`, exit codes 0/1/2, mapping `CodegenError`/`LinkError` to exit 2. Its done-when: remove the `#[ignore]` on `tests/programs.rs` and `m1/arith.la` passes — milestone 1 complete. See `TODO.md`.
