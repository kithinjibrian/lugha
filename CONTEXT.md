# CONTEXT.md — lugha

Session handoff file. Updated at the end of every session.
Read at the start of the next session alongside CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, and DECISIONS.md.

Every session has a name and a state: open | closed.
A session is closed only after CONTEXT.md is committed and pushed.

## SESSION 1 — 2026-10-09 — Context system setup — open

Branch: main

### WHAT WAS DONE

Scaffolded the AI context system described in `setup.md`, adapted from its TypeScript examples to Rust: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, .llmignore, PRPs/ templates, docs/CODE_STYLE.md and the docs/ and reports/ folder structure. Project-specific facts that are not yet known (crate layout, error crate, edition/MSRV) were opened as decisions rather than guessed. `docs/DESIGN.md` was skipped — there is no UI.

Then reviewed `docs/specs/Language v0 Specification.md` and fixed its inconsistencies at the user's request: symbol prefixes (`lugha_fn_` / `lugha_rt_`), milestone 2 test program, struct passing, negative literal folding, negative repeat counts, exact acceptance outputs and float formatting, associativity, prefix grammar, `void` as a non-value. Source extension changed from `.lugha` to `.la`. PRP filenames set to `prp-{NNN}-{feature_name}.md`.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
CLAUDE.md                 — behavioral rules, Rust-adapted
MEMORY.md                 — initial decisions (Rust/GPL, Result-based errors)
CONTEXT.md                — this log
DECISIONS.md              — DECISION-001..003 open, DESIGN.md deferred
CHANGELOG.md              — Unreleased block
TODO.md                   — outstanding setup and project tasks
.llmignore                — protected paths
PRPs/TEMPLATE.md          — PRP template
PRPs/DISCOVERY.md         — discovery interview protocol
docs/CODE_STYLE.md        — rustdoc and comment rules
docs/**, reports/         — empty folders (.gitkeep)
docs/specs/Language v0 Specification.md — inconsistencies fixed, extension .la
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- None — no code yet.

### DECISIONS MADE

- Rust conventions replace the guide's TS ones: unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules, integration tests in `tests/`, `///` rustdoc, `Cargo.lock` protected from hand edits.
- File size limit set to 300 lines (the guide's default).
- PRP filenames: `prp-{NNN}-{feature_name}.md`, three-digit number, snake_case name.
- Source file extension is `.la`.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- DECISION-001 — What lugha is and its crate layout
- DECISION-002 — Error derive crate
- DECISION-003 — Rust edition and MSRV

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- DECISIONS.md, MEMORY.md, CLAUDE.md STACK/ARCHITECTURE and TODO.md not yet updated from the spec.
- DECISION-001 is mostly answered by the spec (lughac, Rust + inkwell); crate layout still open.

---

## NEXT SESSION START POINT

Update DECISIONS.md / MEMORY.md / CLAUDE.md / TODO.md from the v0 spec. Resolve the crate-layout part of DECISION-001 with the user, then `cargo init` accordingly, fill in CLAUDE.md STACK / ARCHITECTURE RULES / FILE ORGANIZATION, and work down `TODO.md`.
